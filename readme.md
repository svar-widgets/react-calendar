### :hammer_and_wrench: How to Use

Import the package, pass an `events` array and a `date`, and optionally attach the editor through the calendar API:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Calendar, Editor, Willow } from '@svar-ui/react-calendar';
import '@svar-ui/react-calendar/all.css';

const events = [
  {
    id: 1,
    text: 'Team standup',
    start: new Date(2026, 3, 20, 9, 0),
    end: new Date(2026, 3, 20, 9, 30),
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    text: 'Sprint planning',
    start: new Date(2026, 3, 20, 10, 0),
    end: new Date(2026, 3, 20, 11, 30),
  },
];

export default function App() {
  const [api, setApi] = useState(null);

  return (
    <div style={{ height: 600 }}>
      <Willow>
        <Calendar init={setApi} events={events} date={new Date(2026, 3, 20)} />
        {api && <Editor api={api} />}
      </Willow>
    </div>
  );
}
```

By default, the calendar exposes `day`, `week`, and `month` views. Add extra view ids through the `views` prop to enable `agenda`, `year`, `resources`, or `timeline`.
